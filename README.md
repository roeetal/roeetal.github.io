# Personal Website

I created this website not only because I wanted to learn web development but also because I have a deep interest in technology and design and wanted to share my passion and experiences with other people.

The website is constructed using scss and allows for "object oriented" page design. Essentially, each page is a full screen and allows for the intsertion of text and images with the customizability of the background colour or image.

TODO:
- Make responsive for mobile.
- Add page for work done at the Quantum Devices Group.
