                <h3>About me</h3>
                <p>
                  I created this website not only because I wanted to learn a bit of web development but also because I have a deep interest in technology and wanted to extend my passion and experiences to family and friends.<br></br>
                  There is a part of me that is always thinking of new technological innovations. I often like to try come up with my own ideas that could allow people to do really epic things, whatever they may be. This part of me also likes abstract mathematics and physics and is always wanting to learn more about each them. My dream is to work on an innovation of the future, like a 'personal quantum computer' for example.<br></br>
                  There is also this other part of me: and this part of me like to think of us, humans. How we think; why we do the things that we do; how we behave as individuals and as communities.
                  In my ideal world, I will spend the next couple of years working on the aforementioned, and maybe even try merge the worlds of mathematics and physics with that of philosophy. Hopefully the content on this website will aptly communicate how my journey is going...<br></br>
