Our current version of Trillium consists of three STMs (pictured left) which continuously work together and compare their calculations in order to ensure a successful mission.
                       I programmed Trillium in C with a focus on making the code scalable and modular. Next, I will work on making the OS for Trillium.</p></div>

                <h3>About me</h3>
                <p>
                  I created this website not only because I wanted to learn a bit of web development but also because I have a deep interest in technology, and wanted to extend my passion to family and friends.<br></br>
                  There is a part of me that is always thinking of new technological innovations. I often like to try come up with my own ideas that could do really epic or helpful things for people. This part of me also likes abstract mathematics and modern physics and is always wanting to learn more about each them. My dream is to work on an innovation of the future, like the personal quantum computer for example.<br></br>
                  There is also this other part of me: and this part of me like to think of us, humans. How we think; why we do the things that we do; how we behave as individuals and as communities.
                  In my ideal world, I will spend the next couple of years working on the aforementioned, and maybe even try merge the worlds of mathematics and physics with that of philosophy. Hopefully the content on this website will aptly communicate how it's all going so far.<br></br>
