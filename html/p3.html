            Trillium is a redundant MCU system which uses three STM32 boards to process data while simultaneously verifying each other's processes. 
            It's main purpose is to reduce the risk of bit flips and other potential radiation hazards in space. 
            Our paper on Trillium was accepted by the International Astronautical Congress and published in their journal.
