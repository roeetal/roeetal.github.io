      Language is difficult to learn because it is fluid and has far less structure then many of the other subjects we learn. Many children have difficulty recognizing the patterns inherent in languages, and so learning a language becomes an arduous task for them. The theme for the hackathon was education and we decided to develop a comprehension tool designed to help children with the aforementioned problem.
      <br>
      Using Google's Syntaxnet (a Tensorflow library for natural language processing) we created a web application that was able to parse and manipulate a text. And using linguistics algorithms, we developed a question generator that can generate relevant questions from the content in the text. The motivation behind the web app was to ask the reader a question after very few paragraphs. If the reader answered correctly, they would simply continue. If they answered incorrectly, the application would use interact with the user via the text by highlighting or underlining words as hints. The app would also try recognize if there are repetitive conceptual flaws in the reader's answer and target the relevant content for its hints. The app attempts to force the reader to recognize certain patterns in the language until the reader begins to understand them.

      Often, children with comprehension or learning difficulties do not understand why they are missing key concepts and where in the text are the key ideas. The problem is that there isn't always a parent, teacher or tutor available to help and explain to the chid where he/she went wrong and how they can improve. It is also difficult trying to help someone learn a foundational skill, such as reading, without just telling them whether they are right or wrong as is often done nowadays. For children with comprehension difficulties, learning to read requires practice and guidance. For future considerations, we envisioned a system with access to all of the school's or child's materials. With this sleemless integration into the classroom, we also thought about developing personalized student feedback for the teachers.

        The web application we developed uses modules from Google's Syntaxnet (a Tensorflow library for natural language processing). This part of the application is dedicated to parsing text and learning how to do so with increasing accurately. On top of this fountational layer, we thought up and implemented some algorithms to generate questions, answers and hints from the parsed text. The final part of the web app, the interface, allows the user to input the book or text they are reading. As the user finishes a paragraph, or multiple of paragraphs, artificially generated questions will appear. The userâ€™s response will be process and compared to the answers. If the user answered correctly they can continue reading. If they did not, hints (in the form of certain overlooked key words) can appear as underlined, bold or colourful in the text as the user rereads the section.
