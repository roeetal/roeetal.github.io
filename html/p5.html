            Many children often have difficultly learning a language because they fail to recognize characteristic patterns or complexities in the text their are reading.
            We created a web application that was able to parse, "comprehend", and manipulate a text while being read to provide a dynamic learning environment for 
            the reader. Using linguistics algorithms, we developed a question generator that subtly ask content based questions while the user reads. 
            Once answered the question simple disappeared. If answered incorrectly, however, the application would start providing hints via the text 
            by highlighting or underlining words, which target the conceptual flaws that the reader is making. The goal of the application is to help the
            reader develop their pattern recognition and comprehension skills.
