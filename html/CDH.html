  <div class="body-slider"><p>Trillium is a redundant MCU system which uses three STM32 boards to process data while simultaneously verifying each other's processes. It's main purpose is to reduce the risk of bit flips and other potential radiation hazards in space. I spend the last two semesters developing and testing Trillium. Next, I will work on making the operating system for it. A paper on Trillium was accepted to the International Astronautical Congress and I expect to present it in September as lead of the CDH subteam.</p></div>
